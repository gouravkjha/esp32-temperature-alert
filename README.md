# ESP32 Temperature Alert System

This is a beginner-friendly project made using ESP32 and DS18B20 temperature sensor.  
The system lights up different LEDs and activates a buzzer based on the temperature.

##  Components Used
- ESP32
- DS18B20 Temperature Sensor
- Red, Green, Orange, White LEDs
- Buzzer
- Resistors (220Î© for LEDs)
- Breadboard and jumper wires

##  How it Works
- **Green LED**: Temperature is normal (10Â°C to 45Â°C)
- **Orange LED**: High temperature (45Â°C to 60Â°C)
- **Red LED + Buzzer**: Critical temperature (Above 60Â°C)
- **White LED + Buzzer**: Very low temperature (Below 10Â°C)
